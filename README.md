A soil-plant-atmosphere model based on MAESTRA and SPA
===================================================
  
Compiles with :
* Intel Visual Fortran Compiler (version >10). 
* gfortran

A Makefile is provided to compile Maes* on a Mac (thanks to Martin de Kauwe and Alejandro Morales).

Note: On Mac OS X, Xcode no longer comes with gcc and instead uses clang. Clang won't compile fortran.
GCC is fairly easy to install using Homebrew (http://brew.sh/) and the command: brew install gcc
